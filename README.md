# A Clock That Shows 2 Time Zones

Distance has taught me many things throughout three years of studying abroad. We often take what we already have for granted. It is not until we no longer have these advantages that we would learn to appreciate and value them. __Through HTML, CSS and Javascript, I designed a clock that tells multiple times at the same time__ in order to remind myself that distance doesnâ€™t make any difference when it comes to those who care about us, no matter it is our friends or family.
